### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Adithya Raviraja, currently a freelancer but also actively looking for full time roles as a backend developer :). 
I have a B.E degree on Computer Science and Engineering for BMS College of Engineering Class of 2018. I have primarily worked in
the enterprise storage domain focusing on Data Replication and Synchoronization over various mediums. As a result I have a great knowledge in 
linux, multithreading and distributed architectures. I have a good knowledge in network filesystems such as NFS3 and SMB2 due to
my prior work experience in the protocol and networking domain. 

Of recent, as a freelancer I have worked on backend web projects using tools such a Django and Django Rest Framework and played around with
Javascript. I enjoy learning new technologies and tools and have a passion in diving into the unknown.
